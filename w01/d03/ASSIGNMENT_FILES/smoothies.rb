# Write a function called blend.
# It should take all the smoothie ingredients (not the measurements) and chop up and mix all the characters
# and output a mixed string of characters
# Be sure to remove the spaces, as we don't want any air bubbles in our smoothie!

def blend(smoothie_ingredients)
end


# create a class called Blender
# It should have a method that takes an array of ingredients and returns a mixed string of characters.
# Give the blender an on and off switch and only allow the blender to function when it's on.
# FOR SAFETY'S SAKE When you create a new blender by default it should be off.
# Blend the the smoothie array

class Blender
