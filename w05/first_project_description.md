## FIRST PROJECT DESCRIPTION

It's time to put everything that you've learned in the past month together! For the first project you will use your knowledge of front and back-end web development to produce an awesome web application that can be used by friends, family or any of the other billions of people who use the Internet. 

The objective of this project is to:

* To pull everything together by building a web application from the ground up.
* To demonstrate mastery of topics covered during this course so far.

You will be working **individually** for this first project. Show us what you've got!

## Starting Suggestion:
* Build a 3 model C.R.U.D. application that pulls in data via an api!

## CORE REQUIREMENTS
Make sure to do all of the following with your app.

* **Models.** Your app should have at least 3 models. Make sure they are associated correctly.
* **Testing**  All of your models must be tested.  That is to say, any logic contained in your models must be tested.  This includes any class or instance methods that you define in your models, as well as the behavior or your associations.
* **Views.** Use partials to DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) up your views.
* **Handles invalid data.** Forms in your application should validate data (on the **BACKEND** in models and controllers) and handle incorrect inputs. Validate sign up information, verify necessary model fields are populated (not blank) for required fields, valid email addresses, etc.
* **Use an API** APIs add data and functionality to your app (some have gems.)
* **User Login.** Make sure you have a user model with basic authentication and authorization set up.
* **Heroku.** Deploy your code to Heroku with a PostgreSQL database.


## PLANNING & DELIVERABLES

####Project Plan deliverables:

* **Scope.** What are you planning to build? What features will it have? What do you think you can reasonably implement in the time period?
* **Object Models.** Draw out the model associations for your project.  Pen and paper is very easy and you can take a picture to save it, or use software like PowerPoint, Keynote, Gliffy (online), and Omnigraffle ($$).
* **Wireframes.** Recall our first day and the "about you" table drawingsâ€¦  Sketch out what a few of your core pages will look like and how they will work and link between each other. Again, pen and aper works great. You can also check out wireframing software like Protoshare or Balsamic.
* **Resources.** Gather the necessary resources and bookmark links to any documentation or references you will be using in your project.  Add them to your `README.md` in a section called "Resources."
* **Milestones.** We will give you some dates and milestones to help keep you on track. Outline some specific milestones for yourself based on how you prefer to work, as they fit into our class milestones.
* **`CHANGELOG.md`** Projects use a "Change log" to keep track of what has happened and what changes were made. Check out [the pry CHANGELOG](https://github.com/pry/pry/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) for an example. Use the milestones here to show the progress.
* **`README.md`** Projects need a readme file in markdown explaining their project.  Explain your concept and data model.  What problem are you solving?!  Add your list of resources  (what gems and APIs are you using?), research, and documentation links to this file.
* **Planning board**. We will be using Trello for this. It is simple and lightweight. Your planning board needs to show the user stories and project completion status.

####Completed Project deliverables:

In addition to your `README.md` file with the project plan and the `CHANGELOG.md` in your OWN repository on GitHub, add the following to your folder in the work repository under your name folder for week 5 (create a `README.md` file there):

* Link to Heroku hosted project
* Link to source code on GitHub


## TIMELINE

In the morning when you walk into class:

* **Thursday**
	* 3+ different ideas on project topics and the real-life tool you can build
* **Friday**
	* Project plan deliverables due including a project backlog
* **Monday**
	* Data model complete (including, of course, the `User` model) and hosted on Heroku
	* Project should also be hosted in a new repository under your own account on GitHub.
	* Update your `README.md` file in the work repository under week 5 accordingly to include these URLs. 
	* You have code that successfully obtains the data you want from your API.
* **Tuesday**
	* Users can create an account and sign in on Heroku. 
	* Core functionality nearing completion (back-end rails stuff, api connectivity established and functional, etc.)
* **Wednesday**
	* Core functionality complete, working on front-end styling and layouts.
* **Thursday** 
	* Completed project deliverables due.  Prepare presentation and succinct explanation of project, concepts, and explanation of decisions.

End of the week:

* Thursday day - In-class demos.
* Thursday night - Retrospective.  What worked well?  Where could my project be improved?  How could my process be improved?
* Friday - Students Exercises & Instructors Code Review
* Over the long weekend - Take advantage of it and relax!  It's one of the few WDI mental breaks.


###Daily deliverables:

2-minute summary in the format of a "daily scrum" and including:

* What happened yesterday?
* Which user stories are to be completed today?
* Any obstacles/blocks for today's stories?

Use a Trello board to keep track of your user stories. Use a `CHANGELOG.md` in your project repository to keep track of progress and changes.


## Things to keep in mind
Make sure that your code and files are:

* In the proper places. Any business logic in views? [Fat controllers](http://www.sitepoint.com/10-ruby-on-rails-best-practices/)?
* DRY.  Can I reuse parts of the code in different areas of the project?
* Commented where necessary. Will anyone else quickly understand what is going on in your controllers, models, etc?
* Well-formatted. Write pretty code: indent properly, format consistently.
* Adheres to the code formatting styles we've been presenting in class.

We'll also be looking at:

* Quality of communication around decision-making. Can you defend why you chose a certain technology or why you implemented your solution in a certain way?
* Your ability to pick up new technologies, research, and push yourself.

### On the topic of Github issues
When opening a Github issue, you will need to put the following three things:

1. What you want to accomplish
2. What error you are getting / what is not working (A screenshot is worth a thousand words, but words are nice too)
3. What you tried


# most importantly...
## Work on something you *like* and
## Have fun!
